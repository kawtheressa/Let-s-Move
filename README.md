This app allows users to select an image file, converts it into a GIF using the GIPHY API, and displays the resulting GIF.

To use this app:

- Replace 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY' with your actual GIPHY API key.
- Ensure you have CORS enabled on your server or use a proxy server to bypass CORS restrictions if you encounter any issues with the API request.
- Install Axios if you haven't already: npm install axios.
- Run your React app with npm start.
